  <h2>
    May 2021 - Present
  </h2>
  <h1>
    Overview
  </h1>
  <p>
    I have been lucky to be involved in many aspects of Inertia's business so far. In my first six months I helped developed a low-cost emergency ventilator from the ground-up for a 
    company called Ligand Innovation Global. Their goal is to develop a low-cost ventilator to be used in resource-limited settings where the only other alternative 
    would be a human squeezing a CPR bag for hours. A link to their website is <a href="https://www.ligandglobal.com/lifeairishere">here</a>, with a cool video that explains the device.
    (If you skip to timestamp 3:30 on that video you may find someone that looks familiar!)
    To bring this product to life, I performed tasks such as scoping concept feasibility, developing mechanical designs, building 3D-printed mock-ups and production-BOM prototypes, 
    performing risk analyses, writing quality documentation (such as the user manual), as well as executing verification and validation testing. I was a client-facing team member, which meant
    I created update reports that were presented to the Client weekly and ensured the Client's needs were always met. 
  </br>
    I then transitioned into management responsibilities, such as maintaining project accounts and managing project leads, identifying process deficiencies 
    and creating SOPs to address them, as well as engaging with Clients from many projects to ensure their feedback for the company is captured and acted upon. 
</br>
    Throughout these projects I have also been leading a research study into state-of-the-art technologies to further the company's knowledge. 
  </p>
  <h1>
    Skills Used
  </h1>
  <p>
    All aspects of the engineering design process were used to build the ventilator.
    Mechanical design was used to develop smooth internals and nitty-gritty problem solving helped me design a breathing circuit that met the device's needs. 
    I used hands-on skills to build the 3D-printed mock-ups, solder and test electrical components, and assemble the production-level devices. 
</br>
    I believe being a good engineer requires soft skills as much as technical ones, and I am happy that I get to use my interpersonal skills between teammates and Clients 
    regularly. Since many Clients are not engineers, translating highly technical content into palatable weekly updates is an important part of the job and something I enjoy doing.
    This goes both ways, however, and I also had to capture the Client's needs and transform them into technical requirements for the device that is being designed. 
</br>
    Finally, I used critical thinking and analytical skills constantly throughout the three major projects I have been involved in so far.
    Specifically in the research of new technologies, analysing data and determining its value before presenting subsequent conclusions to the team kept things efficient and boosted productivity.
  </p>
  <h1>
    What I Learned
  </h1>
  <p>
    Designing a ventilator from concept through to production-level prototype in six months was an exciting challenge. 
    I learned to think on my feet, take initiatives, and ask for help when I need it. 
    It's best to fail fast and ask for feedback regularly to keep oneself and the team on track.
</br>
    I also proved to myself that I am able to wear many hats within an organization and perform a variety of tasks, showing my willingness to learn and openness to change.
